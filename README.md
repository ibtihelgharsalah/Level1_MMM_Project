# Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Project with Microsoft Excel: Level 1

Welcome to my first Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) project repository. This project is an application of MMM techniques using Excel, focusing on analyzing the impact of various sales drivers on the number of account subscriptions (KPI) relative to an online book store.

## Overview

In this project, I leverage Excel and its Analysis ToolPak to perform data exploration, regression analysis, and transformation techniques such as Adstock and Diminishing Returns to gain insights into the relationships between different factors and subscription numbers which will help the business derive future data-based marketing decisions.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: I begin by exploring the raw dataset and mapping each independent variable against the KPI (accounts subscriptions).
2. **First Regression Modeling**: A primary linear regression model is built using raw data.
3. **Data Transformation**: I perform Adstock and Diminishing Returns transformations on raw media data to enhance model accuracy.
4. **Final Modeling**: The final linear regression model is developed using transformed data, and coefficients are analyzed to measure the contribution and ROI of each factor to total subscriptions.
5. **Business Recommendations**: Based on the model results, I generate insights and recommendations for optimizing marketing strategies and maximize profit.
